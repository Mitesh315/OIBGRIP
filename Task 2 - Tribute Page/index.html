        A rare soul who always lived for others and at the same time remained
        totally absorbed in God. A peaceful, humble, simple and spiritual
        personality – this is<br />
        Pramukh Swami Maharaj<br>
        (Shastri Narayanswarup Das)

      <div class="intro">
        Pramukh Swami Maharaj was the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan
        Swaminarayan. His message, “In the joy of others, lies our own” inspired
        over a million followers around the globe to offer dedicated service to
        God, guru and society. Pramukh Swami Maharaj reached out to all sections
        of society, visiting more than <b>250,000 homes</b> in <b>17,000 villages</b> and
        cities, and personally counselling and comforting more than<b> 810,000
        people</b> also answered more than <b>7 lakhs of letters </b>from devotees seeking 
        advice for their life problems and blessings from them. His natural 
        humility, compassion for humanity, universal wisdom
        and striking simplicity touched many religious and national leaders. But
        most important of all was his quiet, undisturbed love for God.

          <p class="work-desc">A mandir is not merely a venue for ceremonies and rites. It serves as a place where 
            spirituality, social services and culture flourish. Pramukh Swami Maharaj has revived the ancient tradition
             of mandirs by constructing over 1,100 mandirs in tribal villages to metropolitan cities.
             Countries include: India, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan, South Africa, Malawi, Botswana, UAE, 
             Bahrain, Portugal, Belgium, UK, Canada, USA, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore and others.<br>
             Traditional, shikharbaddha BAPS mandirs: 34 in India; 8 abroad: London (UK), Toronto (Canada), Chicago (USA), 
             Atlanta (USA), Houston (USA), Los Angeles (USA), Robbinsville (USA) and Nairobi (Kenya)<br>

        <div class="work-card"><div class="work-title">MORE THAN 1,000 EDUCATED SADHUS FOR SOCIETY</div>
          <p class="work-desc">There are three foundational pillars of Indian culture – scriptures, mandirs and sadhus. 
            Pramukh Swami Maharaj has strengthened all three of these foundational pillars in many ways. Of these, he has 
            inspired more than 1,000 educated youths to renounce the world and gifted society with a pious cadre of sadhus.
            These sadhus are highly respected in society. To nurture their spirituality, Pramukh Swami Maharaj established
            the BAPS Sadhu Training Centre in the holy village of Sarangpur. This training centre has been active for over
            three decades. After the great spiritual teacher Adi Shankracharya, Pramukh Swami Maharaj is widely acclaimed
            by spiritual leaders for inspiring youths to live as renunciates for the uplift of society.</p>

          <img class="work-img" src="https://pramukhswami.org/PSM/media/work/schools_by_pramukhswami.jpg">
            <p class="work-desc">Education is not merely for earning money to sustain one’s family, but also for encouraging
            inner progress in life. Therefore, Pramukh Swami Maharaj has established educational institutions to help bolster 
            this union of values and education. From establishing student hostels in tribal villages, to a renowned school in 
            England, these educational institutions by BAPS provide an environment for students to progress in their academic 
            careers and to also develop students as contributing members of society. These educational institutions created by 
            Pramukh Swami Maharaj will benefit youths for generations to come.</p>

               BAPS mobile clinics treat hundreds of thousands of people free of charge in tribal and rural areas. Pramukh Swami 
               Maharaj has inspired hospitals, dispensaries, health fairs, medico-spiritual conferences and other health-related services.<br>

              them a new life.</p>
